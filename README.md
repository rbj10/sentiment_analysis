This repository shows the details of sentiment analysis of movie reviews. I have used the following imdb review kaggle dataset https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews/download. The RNN model is built with 2 layers of LSTM units. The text data have been cleaned, preprocessed and the model has bas been built and evaluated in this repository.
